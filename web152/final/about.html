            <h3>The Pacific Trails Area</h3>
            <p>
              Pacific Trails is located in the Golden Gate National Recreation
              Area, one of the most visited and largest national parks in the
              world. Pacific Trails was established to help make it easier for
              the urban population to visit national parks and experience
              nature's beauty. Our hiking trails start from the Golden Gate
              Bridge and cover over 5 miles of land.
