    <p>My go-to coffee order in the morning is the classic vanilla latte! This drink contains a shot of espresso, milk, and vanilla syrup. Depending on the weather, I will order it either iced or hot. It's such a simple order yet delicious and smells great. It has just the right amount of sweetness and caffeine to get me going.</p>
